# To-Do Webpage

A simple, interactive to-do list webpage that allows users to add tasks, organize them into categories (`To-Do`, `Doing`, `Completed`), save the list to a `.txt` file, and upload previously saved tasks. This project demonstrates basic front-end web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
